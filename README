My 11th homework in OTUS online school on course "Linux system administrator".

For start OpenVPN client on your machine you must run command "sudo openvpn --config ./host-tun.conf" from vagrant directory, after:
1. Running "vagrant up" in project direcory;
2. Modifying server ip in ./host-tun.conf;
3. Creating two file (ca.crt and tun.key);
Information for steps 2 and 3 you will see in console after finishing processing "vagrant up" command.

You can SSH between client and server VMs and host via SSH keys (on client and server VMs keys deploys automatically).
For SSH from host to server VM (via server_HOST-LAN_IP and server_OVPN_IP) you must add ./vagrant_ovpn to ~/.ssh/ directory, and add to ~/.ssh/config these lines:
-------------------------
Host {IP_from_vagrant_up_Output}
  HostName {IP_from_vagrant_up_Output}
  User root
  IdentityFile /home/{username}/.ssh/vagrant_ovpn

Host 10.0.0.5
  HostName 10.0.0.5
  User root
  IdentityFile /home/{username}/.ssh/vagrant_ovpn
-------------------------
Command for Vi, that can be usefull - ":%s/    client: //gc". It will delete all confirmed parts of strings with "    client: " in file.
